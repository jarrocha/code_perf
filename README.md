# code_perf


These blog series belong to some old notes that I have that I though could be
useful to redo. It is always good to refresh material and what a better way than
to write about it.

These series will consists of having some code in C that will iteratively be
re-coded for better performance. Assembly code will be shown so as to present
whatâ€™s going on at the instruction level, grof will be used to quantify our
results.
